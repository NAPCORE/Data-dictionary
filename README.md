## About this Repository
This repo originally hosted the first iterations of the **NAPCORE Data Dictionary**, a collaborative effort to harmonize terminology, definitions, and metadata across European ITS and mobility data catalogues.

It served as a starting point for:
- Collecting draft definitions and concepts
- Testing approaches for open data catalogue alignment
- Sharing early documentation and examples

---

## Migration to the New Repository
The work has now been **carried over** to [NAPCORE/its-data-dictionary](https://github.com/NAPCORE/its-data-dictionary/), which provides a more structured and maintainable environment.

### What’s New in the Structured Repository
The new repo introduces:
- **Clearer folder structure** separating schemas, definitions, and documentation
- **Machine-readable formats** (JSON, YAML, CSV) for easier integration and validation
- **Versioning and provenance tracking** to support long-term governance
- **Improved contributor guidelines** for consistent updates and community input
- **Alignment with NAPCORE catalogue tooling** to ensure interoperability across National Access Points

## Next Steps
If you are looking to:
- Contribute new terms or definitions
- Reuse the dictionary in your own ITS projects
- Follow ongoing development and discussions
