# DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2024/490 amending DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2017/1926 supplementing the ITS Directive (2010/40/EU)
## Assumptions and introductory remarks

1. Transmodel uses the term ‘modes of operation’ and the following categorization:\
• Conventional modes (of operation):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Scheduled\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Flexible\
• Alternative modes (of operation):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Vehicle pooling\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Vehicle rental\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Vehicle sharing\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Taxi\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Personal modes (of operation)
2. Demand-responsive transport modes according to the terminology of DR (EU) 2017/1926 (or on-demand as appear on amendment DR (EU) 2024/490) are associated in this document with flexible and alternative modes (of operation) according to the terminology of Transmodel.

## Types of Static, Historical, and Observed Travel and Traffic Data

### Level of Service 1 (data regarded as essential for the basic functioning of multimodal travel information services)

**Location search (origin/destination) – _addresses (building number, street name, postcode)_:** the minimum information required for matching specific locations (mainly properties) as trip origins and destinations based on their address.

>The following data needs to be provided for an address:\
• Identifier (must be globally unique)\
• Name\
• Coordinates (Centroid)\
• Topographic or address identifiers\
• Category of classification

>The following data is optional for an address:\
• External identifiers (e.g., for OpenStreetMap (KeyList)\
• Additional coordinates (access)\
• Area\
• Validity

    <td>NeTEx POSTAL ADDRESS</td>
    <td>A specification of ADDRESS refining it by using the attributes used for conventional identification for mail. Comprises variously a building Identifier, Street name, Post code, and other descriptors.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

>BEST PRACTICES\
• Addresses that appear in this data type are mostly relevant to the postal address.\
• Examples of this are: building numbers, street numbers, postcodes linked with coordinates or other location references (coordinates will be supplied according to WGS84).\
• When talking of the origin and destination of a trip, it should be made clear if the reference for origin and destination is the physical location of the departure or arrival of the customer’s trip (e.g. from home and to a shopping mall), or the public transport point of origin and destination. In the latter case you need to add information about an access and egress trip leg which is most often not done by public transport (except if you order a taxi or an Uber-like service or some on-demand shuttles).\
• Based on INSPIRE data specification, the postal address constitutes a hierarchy consisting of components with an increasing level of detail, e.g., town, street name, and house number or house name. It may also include a post code or other postal descriptors.\
>Both types of addresses may be used:\
o The reference for postal address format is INSPIRE.\
o The reference for road address is NeTEx.

**Location search (origin/destination) – _topographic places (city, town, village, suburb, administrative unit)_:** the minimum information required for matching wider locations (e.g., areas, regions, localities, cities, suburbs, towns, administrative units, or settlements) as trip origins and destinations based on their name.

>The names of settlements, counties, etc., are of importance for locating trip endpoints, namely for the distinction of place names that are not globally unique.

Based on the Transmodel/NeTEx data specification, TOPOGRAPHIC PLACEs may be located within one single country, may intersect one or more countries, and may be contained inside other topographic places. TOPOGRAPHIC PLACEs can include disambiguation information to ensure that different places with the same name can be distinguished when searching for place names.</td>

**Location search (origin/destination) – _points of interest (related to transport information) to which people may wish to travel_:** the minimum information required for matching specific locations of interest (e.g., amenities, landmarks, tourist attractions) as trip origins and destinations (covers DR(EU)1926/2017 1.b.c).

>The coordinates and/or address identifiers of any point of interest (POI) that are relevant to travellers. For example, a museum, a theatre, or a shopping mall. The following POI should be (at least) provided:\
• Administrative buildings\
• Airports\
• Amenities (such as shopping mall, restaurants)\
• Hospitals\
• Museums, tourist attractions\
• Pharmacies\
• Police stations\
• Ports\
• Protected sites\
• Rental stations\
• Universities, schools

>BEST PRACTICES\
Be aware that there might exist temporary POI as well (e.g. a circus).\
Be aware that some locations are considered as input to trip planners but are not POI in the narrower sense. They are also not modelled as POI, but should still contain the relevant information in their respective data types (e.g. stations, charging stations, parking):\
• Parking (see section on parking)\
• Park & Ride (all vehicles), kiss & ride: covered under “location search – for transport on demand and personal transport: Park & Ride stops”\
• Heavy vehicle parking: covered under DR EU 885/2013 “provision of information services for safe and secure parking places for trucks and commercial vehicles”\
• Charging stations, gas stations (personal operated vehicles): covered under DR EU 2022/670 “provision of EU-wide real-time traffic information services”\
• Public transport stops (see section on stops)

>PROCEDURES\
• The data must follow NeTEx Part 4 (EN 12896-4, European Passenger Information Profile, EPIP) in the structure for the data export.\
• An export as Open Journey Planner (OJP) Location Information is also possible (TS17118, version 2).\
• The data must be actualized at least once a year. In the ideal case any update to a POI (content, existence, coordinates) should be available on the following day.\
• The POI are synchronized with the ones in readily available geobases (e.g. OpenStreetMap) and the national geobases.

>DATA STRUCTURE\
The following data define a point of Interest:\
• Mandatory:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Identifier (must be globally unique): The identifier that is used afterwards in all other data.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Name\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Coordinates (Centroids): A version in WGS84 is mandatory. A local projection can be added.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Category or classification: There can be multiple classification systems used. It is recommended that at least the OSM map feature classification<sup id="fn1">[1](#ref1)</sup> is supported.\
• Recommended:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o External references (e.g., for OSM or a national GeoBase): This helps in using the POI in the diverse world we have.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Source: A reference to the source of the data.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Topographic or address identifiers: If such id exist, they should be provided.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Access and egress points to the road network (doors and gates) – with coordinates: For bigger structures they are needed.\
• Optional:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Area: Some POIs are big and the area covered is of importance.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Validity: If a POI is valid only for a given period. This data can be provided.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Opening hours

• From a topological point of view, access nodes for public transport are zero-dimensional nodes of the transport networks (road, rail, etc.), that may be located by coordinates in a particular Coordinate Reference System, used for the spatial description of the network, where passengers may board or alight from vehicles.\
• From a geographical point of view, access nodes are places that appear in the timetable as locations where vehicles may stop, and passengers may board or alight from vehicles.

>BEST PRACTICES\
• From a topological perspective, connection links serve as a means of explicitly connecting two or more places that are located sufficiently near to each other to make a transfer between the points within a reasonable timeframe.\
• From a geographical perspective, connection links can be addressed as designated paths between two places, which may be made up of ordered sequences of links within a place or between two places representing a step in a possible route for pedestrians, cyclists, or other out-of-vehicle passengers. A common point in both perspectives is that a passenger transfer shall be time- and distance-feasible to be considered valid. In this respect, the attributes of connection links encompassed by this data category should at least include the distance and time duration of each connection link, also allowing for alternative durations for different types of impaired mobility. Moreover, connection links should be mode-specific including at least (and as applies) walking and cycling modes.

>BEST PRACTICES\
• When you order a flight or a long-distance train, you need to be sure that the interchange time proposed in your trip planner allows you to transfer from one PT vehicle to another in normal conditions of operations. The minimum interchange time proposed in the booking phase and accepted when purchasing the tickets must be accepted by the operators.\
• In case your first PT leg arrival time is delayed, you should be informed when you plan your trip and of course when you perform your trip what shall happen in case of incident: e.g. if your next PT vehicle shall wait for you, or what options are proposed if your next PT vehicle is no longer there.

>BEST PRACTICES\
A distinction should be made between two types of OPERATORS:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Transport Service Provider (TSP) responsible for the contract with the customer;\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Transport Service Carrier (TSC) responsible for running the vehicle.\
Take the typical case of code-sharing for flights. A customer purchases a ticket from a given Airline (the TSP), and the flight is operated by another one (the TSC).\
In case of incident prior to the travel (e.g. flight cancelled or delayed), the contact point for the customer is the TSP. In case of incident during the travel (e.g. missed connection due to a delay in the arrival of the first flight or due to a cancellation of the connecting flight) the contact point for the customer is first the relevant TSC, but if no alternative is found the customer the liable company is the TSP.

>BEST PRACTICES\
<u>For scheduled transport modes</u>, timetables must be provided in NeTEx format (part 1 and 2). To allow for European interoperability, they must adhere to the European Passenger Information Profile (EPIP; part 4) and/or to the European Passenger Information Accessibility Profile (EPIAP; part 6, under definition).\
In addition, to facilitate international/worldwide adoption, timetables should be provided in an aggregated form in GTFS format as well by the national access point. The main reason is that GTFS covers many use cases and is a lot simpler to consume than NeTEx.\
• In the context of this data category, vehicles are assumed to carry out specified vehicle journeys conforming to the schedule of availability conditions (specified as bitfields), including modifications possibly decided by the control staff of a transport operator. Based on the public transport reference data model (Transmodel), passing time information encompasses expected departure times, expected waiting times, and in some cases (partially on demand) earliest departure times, and latest arrival times.\
• The time horizon of the timetable is of importance. In some cases, booking occurs up to 120 days in advance.  So having a prospective time horizon of timetables of those 120 days would be idea and should be aspired to. However, the information must also be known in advance. The time horizon can be different according to the mode. For long distance trips 3 information can be obtained up to 3 months in advance, but other local-operated services can provide only 1 month in advance.\
• Coverage: timetable datasets should be as complete as possible for a given country or region. The degree of coverage/completeness should be declared per geographical region (e.g. country) in terms of percentages/fractions (e.g. “100 % of trains in country A are covered” and a description which modes, operators are missing.\
• Partitioning of files: if necessary (for data size or operational reasons), timetables of a country/region may be partitioned onto several files. It must be pointed out, that full XSD validation can’t be done in some of the following cases (reference-id checks). It is also very important, that merging the files is not necessarily easy (e.g. mixed lines, service journeys that exist in more than one file). The following divisions have been seen and ordered in the simplicity of parsing. Usually this creates redundancy or size problems. As the redundancy can’t always be avoided, importers must be able to identify identical copies (e.g. replicated stop place information when dealing with a line-oriented approach):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o One file (network approach)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Complete lines\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Complete operators (and sometimes regions, but this might cause integration problems)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Complete groups based on modes or mode groups\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Site frame and lines without site in separate files\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Files per (NeTEx) frame and multiple timetable frames.\
• File organization: within datasets, the data (XML files) should be organized in a simple and practicable way, with a moderate file size if feasible, allowing for handling in standard XML or text editors.\
• Datasets should be published in compressed form (ZIP archives).\
• File sizes: ZIP archives and files contained therein should have sizes smaller than 2 GB each.\
• Datasets should be provided via HTTPS (TLS) under permalinks, so that they may be retrieved easily and securely by automated scripts.\
• Cross-border services (e.g. international trains) may be included in datasets end-to-end but using whenever possible internationally harmonized/aligned identifiers.\
• Quality checks: datasets should be checked for well-formedness and validity (schema conformance) by the national access points. In the future, specific tools (converters/adaptors/validators) need to be available.\
• In addition to NeTEx (EPIP and/or EPIAP profiles), GTFS versions of the timetables may be provided as well. IDs in GTFS are equal to IDs in NeTEx, so data consumers can use the data best suited to the purpose of need.\
• Interchanges shall be used and supported. Remain seated must be supported. Transregional travel should use interchanges when multiple control systems are involved.\
• The data of each national access point should support the collating of transregional travel by interchanges, id for lines/journeys. Either artificial border points can be introduced, or the data should cover the first commercial stop abroad for outgoing journeys and last commercial stop for incoming journeys. It is better to be able to reference the other parts of the journey than to have to map it with timing information on stops.\
• Splitting, joining of trains should be supported. The splitting can be based on operational information (where there is always only one train on a block) or from the passengers’ point of view. One journey for each composition they can remain in it which is coupled on some blocks.\
• Direct carriages should be supported as well.\
• Equipment and equipment places are modelled. Facilities are shown.\
• Accessibility assessments are provided.\
• Leaving out the physical sites (STOP PLACE/QUAY) is possible, but not recommended. SCHEDULED STOP POINTs should refer to the physical model.  Modelling should be done on the Quay or sector level and not on the STOP PLACE level. Only then foot paths can be modelled correctly.\
• The data should support transfers based on time and paths.\
• The transport operators and their contact data should be up to date.\
• Notices and FacilitySets must be available for stops, parts of a service journey and a service journey.\
\
<u>For transport on demand</u>, offers must be provided in NeTEx format (part 1+2). Unfortunately, neither EPIP nor EPIAP currently deal with demand responsive traffic yet. An indication of how to implement can be found in the technical description used in Switzerland<sup id="fn8">[8](#ref8)</sup> (unfortunately currently only available in German).\
From a business perspective we point to the recent work in Switzerland referenced in further reading, which extends the previous work done in the VDV 462 standard.\
• For area services the areas should be clearly defined, and stops should be within those areas.\
• Booking conditions should be clearly defined.\
• No overlapping areas should exist. For complex spatial layouts multi-polygons should be used.\
• Simple, and clear offers from a user perspective that can be easily combined with other modes of transportation should be preferred.\
\
<u>For vehicle pooling</u>, offers must be provided in NeTEx format (part 5). Unfortunately, neither EPIP nor EPIAP deal with vehicle pooling.  A possible indication on how to do it (especially in GTFS) could be the analysis done in Switzerland<sup id="fn9">[9](#ref9)</sup>.\
• The mode of operation of operators should be clear.\
• Offers and demands should be provided to allow open matchmaking and thus an improved spatio-temporal coverage.\

>PROCEDURES\
<u>For all</u>:\
•	Timetable datasets (ZIP archives) should be generated on a regular periodic basis, at least weekly.\
•	Datasets must be quality-controlled (see best practices above).\
•	The data is aggregated.\
•	The id has to match the id in the real-time data.\
•	The interchanges in the real-time data should match the interchanges in the timetable data.

>DATA STRUCTURE\
<u>For scheduled transport</u>:\
Usually in this section the core data elements are listed. Timetables are a complex structure and EPIP/EPIAP as profiles cover most of it. But still EPIP and EPIAP have some flexibility in their implementation. Therefore, the following implementation restrictions should apply (the list is intended for readers that already studied EPIP and EPIAP):\
•	Use AvailabilityCondition with Bitfields.\
•	Use ResponsibilitySet for Authority and Operator at least.\
•	LineRef should be filled.\
•	Don’t rely on Route.\
As far as possible the concepts should be copied over to GTFS.\
<u>For on-demand transport</u>:\
The data structure for on demand can be taken from the NeTEx standard (part 5), which is no reiterated here. The same holds true for the GTFS-Flex and the VDV 462 standards.\
The previous work on business aspects of on demand done in Switzerland (see further reading) extends on the VDV 462 standard and content-wise constitutes a superset of GTFS Flex.\
<u>For vehicle-pooling</u>:\
As for on demand we do not reiterate the work in the NeTEx standard. Note the previous work in Switzerland which summarizes the unsuccessful approaches to modelling pooling, as well as the suggested extension to GTFS named GTFS pool to accommodate particularly for the smaller companies wanting exchange their offers and demands in a standardized manner.

>BEST PRACTICES\
• For example, a guarantee is that a departing vehicle waits for a minimum amount of time for an arriving vehicle, guaranteeing an interchange for the passengers.\
• It may also describe the prioritized place of interchange between two journey legs.\
• It may also be used to describe that two journeys with different identifiers are in fact operated by the same vehicle, allowing the passenger to stay seated in the vehicle at the interchange point.\
• Interchanges connect two specific journeys at specific proximate stops, or at a single stop.\
• What is “guaranteed” must be clarified, and by whom. The interchange time provided in the booking phase by the trip planner is the responsibility of the trip planner, but the customer should know who is responsible for what in case of missed interchange, and it should be specified if the minimum interchange time is accepted by the operator(s) providing services before and after the interchange.\
• The “guaranteed” interchange time may differ according to the category of traveller (passenger with only hand luggage, passenger with registered luggage, passengers with reduced mobility, children travelling alone, etc.).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o They may refer to long periods in case of air travel (low-cost airlines may operate only part of the year).\
• For on-demand transport it is necessary to provide information on the time between ordering a trip and the time of actual start of the trip, and the trip time computation in itself is a two steps process.

>BEST PRACTICES\
The primary dimensions modelled for road network elements include (INSPIRE – reference):\
• Spatial dimension: Geometric (point, line, and area (topographic)) representation of various elements that are parts of a road network. Typically, the road network is handled as a network of connected linear elements (links) with points (nodes) at the ends of the lines (at junctions, road ends, etc.). Real objects with a function in a network may also be represented in a dataset. Network connectivity within the roads network is essential but between elements in the other networks is an optional spatial aspect.\
• Temporal dimension: All elements in a network may have a temporal validity (i.e., description of when a network element exists or is available in the real world). Optional meta-information on when information about a network element was entered, modified, or deleted may also be included in a dataset.\
• Thematic dimension: The road schema can be thematically displayed via several of the attributes defined within the specification.\
The three dimensions mentioned above are relevant to the physical infrastructure representing the road network.

**Trip plan computation – _cycle network (cycle tracks, cycle lanes, bus-and-cycle lanes, on-road shared with vehicles, on-path shared with pedestrians_**: the minimum information required for describing the topological structure and attributes of cycle networks, essential for trip plan computation purposes.

>There is no dedicated-reference European data standard for this data category. Cycling Network is standardised by ISO TC204 (GDF standard) and as mentioned here only partially by INSPIRE. The classes/attributes of the INSPIRE data specification can to a certain extent be used for segregated cycle streets that are parts of/adjacent to road networks, i.e., road segments the FormOfWayValue of which is bicycleRoad.

>BEST PRACTICES\
Three sub-categories of bikes should be considered:\
• private bikes (used privately), which can be used - for moving or for parking - on roads or streets or dedicated infrastructure (or even shared with pedestrian areas or pedestrian crossings at traffic lights).\
• bike-sharing, which requires specific organisation of services and fare/ticketing (with sub-categories of e-bikes), but which are used for moving in the same conditions as private bikes.\
• bikes boarded in collective public transport modes, which are no longer used as a transport mode.\
In addition to cycling, the category of “e-scooters” should also be analysed separately with the same three sub-categories.

In line with the previous data category, the scope of the current one is limited to personal modes. There is a gap in INSPIRE, namely the classes/attributes of the INSPIRE data specification can to a certain extent be used for walkways and pedestrian zones that are adjacent to/interface with the remaining road network, i.e., road segments the FormOfWayValue of which is walkway or pedestrianZone. Pedestrian zones represent segments of road networks reserved for pedestrian use and closed for regular vehicular use by means of physical barriers (INSPIRE-reference).

### Level of service 1

**Passing times, trip plans and auxiliary information – _disruptions, such as network closures and/or diversions, and when possible, the reason_**: the minimum dynamic information required for disseminating the existence of changes in the normal operation of transport services.

>SIRI can exchange estimated real-time changes to the planned timetable and continuously keep track of minor deviations, cancellations and other disruptions, prior to- or during the service operation.

>NeTEx can be used to exchange alterations to the planned timetable including last-minute changes to the passing times.

**Availability check and location – _for transport on demand and personal transport where relevant - car parking spaces available (on and off-street)_**: the minimum dynamic information required for disseming the availability of on-street and off-street car parking space.

>BEST PRACTICES\
Information of the availability of parking space should ideally specify the accessibility of parking places for wheelchair users (as they require more space for accessing and leaving the vehicle).

>More details on the content and structure of on-street or off-street parking availibility data can be found on the data dictionary of the DATEX II Parking Publication light.
