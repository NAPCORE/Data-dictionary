# DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2024/490 amending DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2017/1926 supplementing the ITS Directive (2010/40/EU)
## Assumptions and introductory remarks

>1. Transmodel uses the term ‘modes of operation’ and the following categorization:\
• Conventional modes (of operation):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Scheduled\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Flexible\
• Alternative modes (of operation):\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Vehicle pooling\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Vehicle rental\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Vehicle sharing\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Taxi\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Personal modes (of operation)\
>2. Demand-responsive transport modes according to the terminology of DR (EU) 2017/1926 (or on-demand as appear on amendment DR(EU)2024/490) are      associated in this document with flexible and alternative modes (of operation) according to the terminology of Transmodel.\

>The term ‘mode of transport’ is used below (changed to ‘mode’).

## Static, Historical, and Observed Types of Travel and Traffic Data
### Level of Service 1 (data regarded as essential for the basic functioning of multimodal travel information services)

**Location search (origin/destination) – _addresses (building number, street name, postcode)_:** the information required for matching specific locations (mainly properties) as trip origins and destinations based on their address.

>The following data needs to be provided for an address:\
• Identifier (must be globally unique)\
• Name\
• Coordinates (Centroid)\
• Topographic or address identifiers\
• Category of classification

>The following data is optional for an address:\
• External identifiers (e.g., for OpenStreetMap (KeyList)\
• Additional coordinates (access)\
• Area\
• Validity

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ROAD ADDRESS</td>
    <td>Specialization of ADDRESS using conventional characteristics such as road number and name for identification of a location along a road.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NeTEx POSTAL ADDRESS</td>
    <td>A specification of ADDRESS refining it by using the attributes used for conventional identification for mail. Comprises variously a building Identifier, Street name, Post code, and other descriptors.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

>BEST PRACTICES\
• Addresses that appear in this data type are mostly relevant to the postal address.\
• Examples of this are: building numbers, street numbers, postcodes linked with coordinates or other location references (coordinates will be supplied according to WGS84).\
• When talking of the origin and destination of a trip, it should be made clear if the reference for origin and destination is the physical location of the departure or arrival of the customer’s trip (e.g. from home and to a shopping mall), or the public transport point of origin and destination. In the latter case you need to add information about an access and egress trip leg which is most often not done by public transport (except if you order a taxi or an Uber-like service or some on-demand shuttles).\
• Based on INSPIRE data specification, the postal address constitutes a hierarchy consisting of components with an increasing level of detail, e.g., town, street name, and house number or house name. It may also include a post code or other postal descriptors.\
>Both types of addresses may be used:\
o The reference for postal address format is INSPIRE.\
o The reference for road address is NeTEx.

**Location search (origin/destination) – _topographic places (city, town, village, suburb, administrative unit)_:** the minimum information required for matching wider locations (e.g., areas, regions, localities, cities, suburbs, towns, administrative units, or settlements) as trip origins and destinations based on their name.

>The names of settlements, counties, etc., are of importance for locating trip endpoints, namely for the distinction of place names that are not globally unique.

>The following data needs to be provided for topographic places:\
• Identifier (must be globally unique)\
• Name\
• Coordinates (Centroid)\
• Topographic or address identifiers\
• Category or classification

>The following data is optional for an address:\
• External identifiers (e.g., for OSM) (KeyList)\
• Area\

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TOPOGRAPHIC PLACE</td>
    <td>A type of PLACE providing the topographical context when searching for or presenting travel information, for example as the origin or destination of a trip. It may be of any size (e.g., County, City, Town, Village) and of different specificity (e.g., Greater London, London, West End, Westminster, St James’s). Based on the Transmodel/NeTEx data specification, TOPOGRAPHIC PLACEs may be located within one single country, may intersect one or more countries, and may be contained inside other topographic places. TOPOGRAPHIC PLACEs can include disambiguation information to ensure that different places with the same name can be distinguished when searching for place names.</td>

**Location search (origin/destination) – _points of interest (related to transport information) to which people may wish to travel_:** the minimum information required for matching specific locations of interest (e.g., amenities, landmarks, tourist attractions) as trip origins and destinations (covers DR(EU)1926/2017 1.b.c).

>The coordinates and/or address identifiers of any point of interest (POI) that are relevant to travellers. For example, a museum, a theatre, or a shopping mall. The following POI should be provided:\
• Administrative buildings\
• Airports\
• Amenities (such as shopping mall, restaurants)\
• Hospitals\
• Museums, tourist attractions\
• Pharmacies\
• Police stations\
• Ports\
• Protected sites\
• Rental stations\
• Universities, schools

>BEST PRACTICES\
Be aware that there might exist temporary POI as well (e.g. a circus).\
Be aware that some locations are considered as input to trip planners but are not POI in the narrower sense. They are also not modelled as POI, but should still contain the relevant information in their respective data types (e.g. stations, charging stations, parking):\
• Parking (see section on parking)\
• Park & Ride (all vehicles), kiss & ride: covered under “location search – for transport on demand and personal transport: Park & Ride stops”\
• Heavy vehicle parking: covered under DR EU 885/2013 “provision of information services for safe and secure parking places for trucks and commercial vehicles”\
• Charging stations, gas stations (personal operated vehicles): covered under DR EU 2022/670 “provision of EU-wide real-time traffic information services”\
• Public transport stops (see section on stops)

>PROCEDURES\
• The data must follow NeTEx Part 4 (EN 12896-4, European Passenger Information Profile, EPIP) in the structure for the data export.\
• An export as Open Journey Planner (OJP) Location Information is also possible (TS17118, version 2).\
• The data must be actualized at least once a year. In the ideal case any update to a POI (content, existence, coordinates) should be available on the following day.\
• The POI are synchronized with the ones in readily available geobases (e.g. OpenStreetMap) and the national geobases.

>DATA STRUCTURE\
The following data define a point of Interest:\
• Mandatory\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o **Identifier** (must be globally unique): The identifier that is used afterwards in all other data.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o **Name**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o **Coordinates** (Centroids): A version in WGS84 is mandatory. A local projection can be added.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o **Category or classification**: There can be multiple classification systems used. It is recommended that at least the OSM map feature classification<sup id="fn1">[1](#ref1)</sup>. is supported.
