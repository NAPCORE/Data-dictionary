# DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 886/2013 supplementing the ITS Directive (2010/40/EU)
## Provision, where possible, of road safety-related minimum universal traffic information free of charge to users
### Dynamic data
**Location of the event/condition:** the minimum information required for disseminating the location of an event/condition that is on-going or time valid.

>The location of an event/condition can correspond to a single geospatial point on a road (point), a part of a road network defined between two points on the same road including an indication of the applicable direction (linear), or a geographic or geometric two-dimensional feature (area). Several methods exist for encoding point, linear, or area locations.

>The encoding of point locations can be achieved as follows:\
•	Point by coordinates\
•	Point along linear element\
•	TPEG Point Location\
•	ALERT-C Point\
•	OpenLR Point

>The encoding of linear locations can be achieved as follows:\
•	Linear within linear element location\
•	ALERT-C linear\
•	TPEG Linear Location\
•	OpenLR Linear\
•	GmlLineString

>The encoding of area locations can be achieved as follows:\
•	ALERT-C area\
•	TPEG Area Location\
•	named Area\
•	GmlMultiPolygon\
•	OpenLR Area

**Category of the event/condition:** the minimum information required for disseminating the type of an event/condition that is on-going or time valid.
>Based on Delegated Regulation (EU) 886/2013, the events or conditions to be covered by the road safety-related minimum universal traffic information service shall consist of at least one of the following categories:\
•	Temporary slippery road (unforeseen condition of the road surface which makes it slippery for a certain amount of time, causing low adherence of the vehicle to the road)\
•	Animal, people, obstacles, debris on the road (situation where animals, debris, obstacles or people are positioned on the road where one would not expect to find them so that an emergency maneuver might be required to avoid them)\
•	Unprotected accident area (area where an accident has occurred, and which has not yet been secured by the competent authority; typically provided by crowdsourcing apps)\
•	Short-term road works (temporary road works that are carried out on the road or on the side of the road and which are indicated only by minimum signing because of the short-term nature of these works)\
•	Reduced visibility (visibility affected by any condition that reduces the sight range of drivers and which might affect safe driving)\
•	Wrong-way driver (vehicle travelling on the wrong side of a divided carriageway against the oncoming traffic)\
•	Unmanaged blockage of a road (any blockage of a road, partial or total, which has not been adequately secured and signposted)\
•	Exceptional weather conditions (unusual, severe, or unseasonal weather conditions which might affect safe driving)

>Standards and protocols utilized by road operators and service providers (DATEX II, DENM, RDS-TMC or TPEG2-TEC) hold a significantly wide vocabulary of event and condition types. Based on a joint effort of TISA, Data for Road Safety Collaboration, DATEX II, and C2C Communication Consortium, these types of events and conditions have been reduced to a common denominator (superset) under which the messages and information provided by using any standard or protocol are equivalent. This superset, encompassing both the impact and cause of an event (see the table below), simplifies the vocabulary that could be used in practice for providing warnings to road users.

| Event category  | Associated individual event types and conditions |
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| Temporary slippery road  | Flooding; Danger of aquaplaning; Surface water hazard; Slippery road; Mud on road; Loose chippings; Oil on road; Petrol on road; Ice; Black ice; Snow drifts; Icy patches  |
| Animal, people, obstacles, debris on the road	 |  Objects on the road; Obstructions on the road; Shed loads; Fallen trees; Avalanches; Rockfalls; Landslips; Animals on the road; People on roadway; Children on roadway; Cyclists on roadway; Large animals on roadway; Herds of animals on roadway; People throwing objects onto the road; Broken down vehicles; Vehicle on fire |
| Unprotected accident area | Unprotected accident area(s); Accident; Accident involving bus; Accident involving lorry |
| Short-term road works | Clearance work; Maintenance work; Slow moving maintenance vehicle(s); Road marking work; Rescue and recovery work; Snowploughs in action |
| Reduced visibility | Visibility reduced; Smoke hazard; Dense fog; Patchy fog; Blowing snow; Serious fire; Fog |
| Wrong-way driver | Vehicle(s) on wrong carriageway |
| Unmanaged blockage of a road | Blocked; Bridge blocked; Tunnel blocked; Exit blocked; Connecting carriageway blocked; Entry blocked |
| Exceptional weather conditions | Heavy snowfall; Heavy rain; Storm force winds; Strong winds; Crosswinds; Strong winds affecting high-sided vehicles; Hail; Thunderstorm |

**Driving behavior advice (where appropriate):** information broadcasted to road users and/or vehicles through available means (e.g., VMS, RDS-TMC, TPEG2-TEC, and C-ITS services) that may include suggestions for modifying/adapting their driving behavior in a way that can improve their safety and minimize the risk of accident.
>This advice may also include diversion recommendations for altering routes, maintaining a safe following distance, accelerating, or decelerating gradually, or even making lane changes to avoid traffic congestion or other hazards.
>This data category is addressed in the NetworkManagement class of DATEXII RRPs for SRTI, specifically by the GeneralInstructionOrMessageToRoadUsers object. The attributes of this object hold messages broadcasted to road users increasing their awareness, prompting them to adapt their speed/driving behavior, and/or use specific equipment that is deemed required (e.g., winter-driving equipment in case of heavy snowfall).
